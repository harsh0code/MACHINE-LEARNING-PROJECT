Logistic Regression Project Report
1. Introduction

The purpose of this project was to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a person’s income is greater than $50,000 per year. I used the Adult Income Dataset (adult_converted.csv) and implemented the solution using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit.

2. Steps Performed
2.1 Data Loading

I started by loading the dataset with Pandas:

df = pd.read_csv("adult_converted.csv")

2.2 Problem Faced – KeyError

While I was preparing the data for training, I faced this error:

KeyError: "['income'] not found in axis"


I got this error because the target column was not actually named “income”.
The column name in the CSV had extra spaces and newline characters, something like:

"Income (label / target)"


Since Pandas could not find a column exactly named “income”, it raised the KeyError.

3. How the Problem Was Solved
3.1 Cleaning and Renaming Columns

To fix this issue, I cleaned the column names to remove unnecessary spaces and newline characters:

df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()
df.columns = df.columns.str.replace(r'\s+', ' ', regex=True)


Then I renamed the target column to a simple name:

df.rename(columns={'Income (label / target)': 'income'}, inplace=True)


After this, I was able to separate the features and target without any errors:

X = df.drop("income", axis=1)
y = df["income"]

4. Model Training

I encoded categorical features, split the dataset into training and testing sets, and trained the logistic regression model using Scikit-Learn. After training, I evaluated the model’s accuracy to understand its performance.

5. Streamlit Application

I built a Streamlit application that performs the following tasks:

Displays the dataset

Trains the logistic regression model

Accepts user inputs

Predicts whether a person’s income is more than $50,000 based on the provided information

The model worked correctly after fixing the target column issue.

6. Conclusion

The main issue encountered during the project was a KeyError caused by an incorrectly formatted target column name. After cleaning and renaming the column, the model ran smoothly and the Streamlit application was able to generate predictions as expected.
